    I’ve had the opportunity this semester to take Technology and Management seminar, as a brief introduction before applying for the Hoeft Technology and Management minor. Throughout the semester, the director and professor Samantha Koon brought different business leaders from mainly Abbott, BP, Synchrony, Boeing, and Caterpillar. Even though many of the speakers were from the same company, the size of the company allowed them to grow their careers in their own specific way. A few speakers really stood out to me and one was Jessie Dengsevang from BP. He was an early talent recruiter and program lead. I loved his analogy about interviewing or even just talking during a coffee chat or career fair as a blind date. I found this very powerful because this logic makes sense. Neither the prospective employee nor the employer know anything about each other. Of course, you should do your due diligence before approaching the company representative, but after that, you need to pitch yourself and show how you can provide value (benefit) to the company and what they can provide you. Amidst all the competition, I feel you forget that this is a two-way street. You are trying to find the perfect match between the company and the candidate.

|------------------|------------------|-----------------|-----------------|

## Code

Source code can be included by fencing the code with three backticks. Syntax highlighting works automatically when specifying the language after the backticks.

````
```javascript
function foo () {
    return "bar";
}
```
````

This would be rendered as:

```javascript
function foo () {
    return "bar";
}
```
